## News 
- ~~The preprint is under review.~~
- ~~The codebase is still under construction and therefore is subject to further modifications.~~
- The paper has been accepted to BMVC 2023 as an oral presentation.
- The model weights have been made available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/8406435).
- The slides and the accompanying video, from which you can gain a better intuitive understanding of the development philosophy, can be accessed via the following [link](https://totalvariation.github.io/publications/).
- ~~I have been focusing on expanding this work to a journal paper and the code is subject to further modifications.~~
- I look forward to collaboration to upgrade the code repo (e.g., having it integrated to the Hugging Face Ecosystem) and extend this work to a full journal paper.

## Navigating the Repo with DeepWiki (powered by [Devin.ai](https://devin.ai/))

A useful document generated by [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/TotalVariation/Exchanger4SITS) can facilitate you navigating the repo, which is pretty amazing. The following two figures are copied from the DeepWiki document, highlighting the critical implementations.

## Notes
- The panoptic segmentation model Exchanger+Mask2Former has been trained by splitting the input into four 64x64 patches and stitch
the prediction results together. Later on, I found this trick is crucial for replicating the results.
